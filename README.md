# nfc-react-native-simple
Module for reading NFC id using React Native (android only)

Try code in example/index.android.js

Don't forget to put example/AndroidManifest.xml to android/app/src/main
and example/nfc_tech_filter.xml to android/app/src/main/res/xml

Run app and touch your phone with any NFC card - it should display card ID.

I spent a lot of time trying to get it work, but no way (may be now it does).
